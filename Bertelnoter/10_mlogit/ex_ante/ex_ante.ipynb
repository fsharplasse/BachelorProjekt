    "The solution to this is exactly as we simulated data for the clogit last week.

As mentioned, we use the first option J = 0 as a baseline.\n",

Then you need to loop over the columns of `v`, except for the very first column, and fill these columns with the product from `x @ beta_j`, where `beta_j` is a column of the beta coefficients for that alternative. Again, since the first option is the baseline, `v` should end up with its first column filled with only zeros, and the rest of the columns should be filled with non-zero values."
