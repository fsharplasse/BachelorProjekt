Bachelorprojekt Datalogi-Ã˜konomi

All code used in the project is found in the folder "Sourcecode". 

The folder "data" contains the original data developed by Sebastian Johansen. 

Firstly run the jupyter notebook "Datatransform", where you need to insert your own path. 
Next the jupyter notebooks "Graphs", which outputs the graphs in the descriptive data section, 
and "ConditionalLogit", that gives the estimation results and price elasticities can get executed. Again you need to insert your own path.
