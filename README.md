Bachelorprojekt Datalogi-Ã˜konomi

All code used in the project is found in the folder "Sourcecode". 

The folder "data" contains the original data developed by Sebastian Johansen. 

We have created a mybinder, which makes it possible to execute all of our jupyter notebooks, and get all outputs.
The jupyter notebook "DataTransform" contains our data cleaning process. 
The jupyter notebook "Graphs" contains all but one graph in our desciptive statistics section.
The jupyter notebook "FuelPrice" contains the graph of fuel prices based on the prices in "priser.xlsx" found on drivkraftdanmark.dk and forsyningstilsynet.dk.
The jupyer notebook "ConditionalLogit" contains our estimation results from the estimated conditional logit model on our cleaned data. Furthermore it contains the price elasticity results and the linear regression from the desciptive statistics section.
